					<h3>Inov-8 Parkclaw G 280</h3>
					<p>Peeking at the sole of this new trail runner, you’d assume it’s meant to tackle tough ground. After all, it’s made using graphene, a honeycomb structure of 
						carbon atoms that, when infused with rubber, creates a tacky outsole that’s more durable than sticky rubber. We’ve seen this tech rolled out to most of Inov-8’s 
						trail line.</p>

					<h3>Skechers GOrun Razor TRL</h3>
					<p>Longtime readers of RW shoe reviews know that we love the Skechers GOrun Razor 3. That road shoe is light, fast, and fun. And it’s remained completely unchanged 
						for almost three years now because it’s just that darn good. But, Skechers has expanded upon the model, releasing a carbon-plated version for road races as well 
						as this off-road running shoe, with a grippy, go-fast sole.</p>

					<h3>Altra Lone Peak 6</h3>
					<p>A few key tweaks mostly dialed in the fit of the Lone Peak 6. Altra removed overlays from the quick-dry air mesh upper to increase flexibility. It also reconfigured 
						the Lone Peak’s closure system with additional midfoot lacing, making the 6 feel slightly more secure than its predecessor, which testers had described as having a 
						“sloppy” fit unless they tinkered with the laces. Still, some had trouble locking in their feet no matter how tautly they laced up.</p>

					<h3>Brooks Caldera 5</h3>
					<p>Hitting gnarly trails? You’ll appreciate the BioMoGo DNA midsole in the Caldera 5. Its softness rivaled Hoka’s Speedgoat 4 GTX for one tester, who had formerly
						 declared herself “a loyal Hoka gal.” That foam, made of durable and lightweight EVA, conforms to your foot, providing a responsive ride and a thick-enough sole 
						 that buffers rugged terrain without a stiff rock plate. While testers lauded the shoe’s softness, I wish Brooks had returned to the low weight of the Caldera 3. </p>

					<h3>Salomon Ultra Glide</h3>
					<p>Traditionally, Salomon’s speedy kicks earn their reputation for being fast, for sure, but also are quite firm, aggressive, and narrow—better suited for elites than 
						midpack runners. The Ultra Glide is Salomon’s most cushioned and most accessible trail shoe. The first time I wore the shoe was on day 5 of a 327-mile FKT run in April.
						 After over 250 miles, the hills, rocks, and hours piled up, and I was craving more protection for the final stretch.</p>
				</article>
					
				<article id="article6">
					<h3>VJ Ultra</h3>
					<p>While VJ running shoes like the Maxx and the XTRM are specifically built for obstacle course racing and trail running, the Ultra is the first shoe from the brand 
						that is specifically designed for mega-distance. It adds considerably more cushioning underfoot for spending hours to days on the trail. The best part of VJ shoes
						 is still the outsole, and the Ultra lives up to the brand’s hashtag #BestGripOnThePlanet. The butyl-rubber outsole is studded with 4mm, chevron-shaped lugs, which 
						 give the Ultra a really tacky hold on wet, jagged surfaces.</p>
